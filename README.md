Week 4 Progress Check
==================
Contained in this file is what Fran and Frank hope will become their new home page. Below are a list of tasks that cover the material we've gone over for the past three weeks. If you feel uncomfortable with any of these please see the learning resources under the task for help.

[Here is a link](http://bit.ly/fran-and-franks-diner) to how the finished site should look.

1. Fork the project and clone it down on your computer.

2. Add the dependencies for Twitter Bootstrap, and JQuery.

3. Link to the script.js and server.js files.

4. Add an h2 element underneath the existing h1 that says "Serving the Salt Lake area since 2008".

5. Center the h1, and h2 elements in the header

6. Unshift the incoming person on the "new_party_joined" function in script.js on to the waitlist array.

7. Pop a name off the waitlsit array in the asssing_to_table function in script.js and remove the li with their id.

8. Grab the total of the purchase text field on click and add a tip of 20% and put the new total in the sub-total span.

9.  Push your changes up to your Github.
